Customising a Bootstrap SASS build
==================================

This project demonstrates an example of customising a Bootstrap SASS build.

This sample project uses `npm` to install Bootstrap-SASS and Gulp to build the
CSS with `gulp-sass`.

Installation
------------

First, you'll need to download and install `bootstrap-sass` and all its related
dependencies using `npm`:

    $ npm install

Then build the CSS by running `gulp`:

    $ gulp

Once you have built the CSS, open `index.html` in your web browser to view the
customized Bootstrap template.

To customize the build further, modify the variables in `css/_variables.scss`.
